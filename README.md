# QRB ROS Audio Service

## Overview

The ROS package provides essential audio capabilities, it is the entry point for ROS to provide audio capabilities.

It supports both step-by-step and one-touch playback, allowing playback from built-in sounds. Additionally, it offers recording functionality, with the option to save to a local file or a topic.

Playback and record capabilities depend on [qrb_ros_audio_common](https://github.com/QUIC-QRB-ROS/qrb_ros_audio_common).
